ABOUT ME
------
I am a senior student at Peking University majoring in computer science and technology, with a secondary major in psychology. [Curriculum Vitae](https://pkuxmq.github.io/files/CV_MingqingXiao.pdf).

My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, including deep learning, optimization, statistical modeling, and interpretable models, as well as their application in computer vision, image processing, and intersection with cognitive science.

I'm currently a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia Machine Learning Group led by Dr. [Tie-Yan Liu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tyliu/). My supervisor at Peking University is Prof. [Zhouchen Lin](https://zhouchenlin.github.io/).

In the summer 2019, I was a visiting student at [CCVL (Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning) lab](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/) in Johns Hopkins University, supervised by Prof. [Alan Yuille](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/).
