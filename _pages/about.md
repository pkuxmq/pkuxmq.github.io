ABOUT ME
------
I am currently a Ph.D. student at Peking University supervised by Prof. [Zhouchen Lin](https://zhouchenlin.github.io/). Previously I obtained my B.S. degree in computer science and technology and B.S. degree in psychology from Peking University in 2020. [Curriculum Vitae](https://pkuxmq.github.io/files/CV_MingqingXiao.pdf).

My research interests lie in machine learning, including deep learning, optimization, as well as their application in computer vision, image processing, and intersection with cognitive science.

In the summer 2019, I was a visiting student at [CCVL (Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning) lab](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/) in Johns Hopkins University, supervised by Prof. [Alan Yuille](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/).

From Sep. 2019 to Jun. 2020, I was a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia Machine Learning Group led by Dr. [Tie-Yan Liu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tyliu/).
