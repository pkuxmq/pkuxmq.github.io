ABOUT ME
------
I am currently a Ph.D. student at Peking University supervised by Prof. [Zhouchen Lin](https://zhouchenlin.github.io/). Previously I obtained my B.S. degree in computer science and technology and B.S. degree in psychology from Peking University in 2020.

My research interests lie in machine learning, including deep learning, optimization, brain-inspired models, as well as their application in computer vision, image processing, and intersection with neuroscience.

In the summer 2019, I was a visiting student at [CCVL (Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning) lab](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/) in Johns Hopkins University, supervised by Prof. [Alan Yuille](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/).

From Sep. 2019 to Jun. 2020, I was a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia Machine Learning Group led by Dr. [Tie-Yan Liu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tyliu/).
