ABOUT ME
------
I am a junior student at Peking University, majoring in computer science and psychology (secondary major). [Curriculum Vitae](https://pkuxmq.github.io/file/CV_Mingqing&nbspXiao.pdf).

I'm currently in Prof. [Zhouchen Lin](http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/faculty/vision/zlin/zlin.htm)'s lab, Peking University. My research interests include machine learning, with emphasis on optimization and computer vision.

In the summer 2019, I will be a visiting student in [CCVL (Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning) lab](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University, supervised by Prof. [Alan Yuille](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/).
